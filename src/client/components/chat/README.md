# Chat Component Custom Scrollbar

## Overview

The chat component now features a custom scrollbar that properly positions itself to avoid being masked by the glass header and input overlays.

## Implementation Details

### Problem Solved
- The default scrollbar was being partially hidden behind the glass header (64px) and input area (160px)
- The scrollbar track extended the full height of the container, making parts of it inaccessible

### Solution
- Custom scrollbar component that positions the track with proper top/bottom margins
- Track starts at 64px from top (below header) and ends 160px from bottom (above input)
- Smooth animations and hover effects for better UX

### Key Features

1. **Proper Positioning**: Scrollbar track respects overlay boundaries
2. **Smooth Interactions**: Throttled scroll updates at 60fps for performance
3. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
4. **Drag Support**: Click and drag scrollbar thumb for navigation
5. **Track Clicking**: Click anywhere on track to jump to position

### CSS Classes

- `.chat-messages-container`: Container with custom scrollbar
- `.chat-messages-scrollable`: Scrollable area with hidden default scrollbar
- `.custom-scrollbar-track`: Custom scrollbar track positioning
- `.custom-scrollbar-thumb`: Draggable scrollbar thumb with animations

### Usage

The custom scrollbar is automatically integrated into the `BasicThread` component:

```tsx
<div className="chat-messages-container">
    <div className="chat-messages-scrollable">
        <CustomScrollbar 
            containerRef={containerRef} 
            onScroll={handleScroll}
        />
        {/* Chat messages content */}
    </div>
</div>
```

### Styling

The scrollbar uses a purple gradient theme matching the AI assistant branding:
- Base: `rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.7)` to `rgba(75, 0, 130, 0.7)`
- Hover: Increased opacity and scale effect
- Active: Full opacity with enhanced glow effect

### Performance

- Scroll updates are throttled to 16ms (~60fps)
- Passive scroll listeners for better performance
- ResizeObserver for responsive updates
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
