@README.md 

Based on your understanding of the code, help me write up an implementaiton plan for the next 3 months. 

The starting point of the plan is on June 17.

The implementaiton plan will consisit of:

I. （1 months) we will overhaul the existing codebase to achieve major functionalities: 
- (First month) Refactor the current codebase to be an internal tool with:
1. Refactor the overall flow into four major steps: ideation (brainstorming) => story outline (linear) => script outline (non-linear; with flashbacks etc, essentially progression of what's shown on screen) => detailed per-episode script
2. Allow modificaiton of all input parameters for previous steps
3. streamable UI for everything (i.e. we will stream everything from LLM as they become avaiable, as opposed to waiting on any components; this is already achieved by a large extent, with some exceptions of some components that have bugs)
4. Improve the quality of generation for common 女频 category. 

Administrative costs:
1. 网络备案（200服务器费用）
2 AIGC备案（5万-10万）


Technology costs:
Assuming this will be used for internal script writers in the company as an internal tool, the fees include: 
1. Server fees (500-1000 RMB)
2. LLM fees (1000-2000 RMB)


Total fees for this phase (1 month): sum up all above and give a range. 

II. (1 months) In this phase We will design the UI to be general consumer

1. Make sure the UI is navigatable and not confusing to the user (needs user testing)
2. More login options (sms login; possibly wechat login)
3. UI is both desktop and mobile friendly 

Technology costs:
1. Server fees (1000-2000 per month)
2. LLM fees (1000-1万)

Administrative costs
1. ICP 经营类备案（5000-20000元）

Write it in a language that stakeholders (very non-technical) could understand. 
Write it in Mandarin Chinese. 

For the two phases, sum up the total cost range. And in the end summarize the total cost.
