now, we want to make all text from the outline editable. let's do it in this way:
0. In the outer level of @OutlineDisplay.tsx , wrap with a special context that contains the artifact and a path. At the root level the path is root. The context is recursive, in the sense that inside the context, we can have another wrapper of the same type of context with the same artifact, and parent path composes with child path to specify the full path.
1. In the UI, Convert ALL elements that display text from the artifact into a special component (MaskedEditableArtifactPathLabel). Use the nested, recursive context to always gain access to the artifact, along with the correct path inside the DOM tree. By default, each UI correspond to one piece of text with a masked label (let's use <span> so as to affect the UI minimally).
2. when the text label is clicked, make its contentEditable to true, while at the same time, create a human transform along with a user_input (of type say chrological_outline
