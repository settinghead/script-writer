# Episode Generation Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🏗️ Backend Infrastructure
- **New Artifact Types**: Added 4 new artifact types for episode generation
  - `OutlineSynopsisStageV1` - Individual stage artifacts
  - `EpisodeGenerationSessionV1` - Session management
  - `EpisodeSynopsisV1` - Individual episode synopsis
  - `EpisodeGenerationParamsV1` - Generation parameters

- **Database Migration**: Created migration to refactor synopsis_stages from arrays to individual artifacts
  - File: `src/server/database/migrations/005_refactor_synopsis_stages.ts`
  - Automatically converts existing data when server starts

- **Episode Generation Service**: Complete service layer
  - `src/server/services/EpisodeGenerationService.ts`
  - Methods for starting generation, getting sessions, managing stages
  - Follows existing patterns from brainstorming and outline services

- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for episode generation
  - `src/server/routes/episodes.ts`
  - Integrated into main server at `/api/episodes`
  - Authentication required for all endpoints

### 🎨 Frontend Updates
- **Button Update**: Changed "生成剧集" to "开始每集撰写" in outline results
- **Navigation**: Updated to navigate to `/scripts/{sessionId}` 
- **New Components**: Basic structure for episode generation UI
  - `EpisodeGenerationPage.tsx` - Main page with tree view
  - `StageDetailView.tsx` - Stage detail component (placeholder)
- **Routing**: Added `/scripts/:scriptId` route to App.tsx

### 🔄 Streaming Infrastructure
- **StreamingTransformExecutor**: Updated to create individual stage artifacts
- **Artifact Types**: Added to common types for frontend/backend sharing
- **Type Guards**: Validation functions for all new artifact types

## 🎯 Ready for Testing

You can now:

1. **Start the server** - Migration will run automatically
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the updated button** - Go to any completed outline and click "开始每集撰写"

3. **Navigate to episode page** - Should show the tree view with stages

## 🚧 Next Development Phase

### Phase 1: Complete Stage Detail View
- [ ] Implement stage parameter editing (episodes count, requirements)
- [ ] Add "Generate Episode Synopsis" button
- [ ] Show stage synopsis content

### Phase 2: Episode Synopsis Generation
- [ ] Create episode synopsis generation template
- [ ] Implement streaming generation with progress
- [ ] Progressive tree expansion as episodes are generated

### Phase 3: Tree View Enhancement
- [ ] Add episode nodes to tree as they're generated
- [ ] Navigate to individual episode detail pages
- [ ] Show episode status (generated, in progress, etc.)

### Phase 4: Episode Detail Pages  
- [ ] Individual episode synopsis editing
- [ ] Episode script generation (next major feature)
- [ ] Episode-specific actions and metadata

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### URL Structure
- `/scripts/{outlineSessionId}` - Main episode generation page
- `/scripts/{outlineSessionId}/stages/{stageId}` - Stage detail view  
- `/scripts/{outlineSessionId}/stages/{stageId}/episodes/{episodeId}` - Episode detail

### Key Patterns Followed
- **Immediate Navigation**: Like brainstorming → outline flow
- **Artifact-based Architecture**: Each stage is its own artifact
- **Transform Tracking**: All changes tracked through transform system
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require user authentication
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build on existing streaming infrastructure

### API Endpoints Available
- `POST /api/episodes/stages/:stageId/episodes/generate` - Start episode generation
- `GET /api/episodes/episode-generation/:sessionId` - Get generation session
- `GET /api/episodes/outlines/:outlineId/stages` - Get stage artifacts
- `GET /api/episodes/stages/:stageId` - Get specific stage
- `GET /api/episodes/stages/:stageId/active-generation` - Check active generation

## 🏃‍♀️ Quick Start Testing

1. Create an outline with synopsis stages
2. Click "开始每集撰写" 
3. Should navigate to episode generation page
4. See tree view with stages from the outline
5. Click on a stage to see detail view (basic placeholder for now)

The foundation is solid and ready for the next development iteration! 🚀
