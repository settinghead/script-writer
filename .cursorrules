# Script Writer Project - Cursor Rules

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Artifacts & Transforms System
- **ALWAYS respect the artifacts => transform => artifacts structure** when changing backend flow logic
- Every data modification MUST be tracked through transforms with proper input/output artifact relationships
- Artifacts are immutable - create new versions rather than modifying existing ones
- Use `TransformExecutor` for all data modifications that need traceability
- Transforms must specify type ('llm' or 'human'), execution context, and status

### 2. API Design Philosophy
- **DO NOT expose artifacts/transforms directly** in server routes - they are low-level constructs
- **DO NOT make frontend interact with artifacts/transforms directly**
- Create domain-specific endpoints (e.g., `/api/ideations`, `/api/scripts`) that abstract the underlying artifacts system
- Frontend should work with business domain objects (IdeationRun, ScriptDocument) not raw artifacts
- Use repository pattern to encapsulate artifact/transform operations

## Security & Authentication

### 3. Authentication Requirements
- **ALL AI/LLM endpoints MUST require authentication** using `requireAuth` middleware
- **ALL data operations MUST be scoped to authenticated user** (`user_id` filtering)
- Use HTTP-only cookies for JWT tokens to prevent XSS attacks
- Validate user ownership before allowing access to any resource
- Room IDs must include user ID for WebSocket security: `script-{user_id}-{timestamp}-{random}`

### 4. Data Isolation
- Every database query MUST filter by user_id for the authenticated user
- Users can ONLY access their own scripts, ideations, and collaborative sessions
- WebSocket connections must verify room ownership before allowing access
- Debug endpoints must scope data to authenticated user only

## TypeScript & Code Organization

### 5. Type Safety
- Use strict TypeScript throughout both frontend and backend
- Define interfaces with version suffixes (e.g., `IdeationSessionV1`) for artifact types
- Keep shared types in `src/common/` for frontend/backend consistency
- Properly type all streaming services and API responses

```


## Database & Performance

### 9. Database Operations
- Use `ArtifactRepository` and `TransformRepository` for flow related data access
- Use `CacheService` for performance optimization


## API Endpoint Patterns

### 11. Route Organization
- Group routes by domain: `/api/ideations`, `/api/scripts`, `/api/brainstorm`
- Use RESTful conventions where appropriate
- Streaming endpoints use `/stream` suffix
- Debug endpoints under `/debug/` (development only)
- Authentication endpoints under `/auth/`

### 12. Request/Response Patterns
- Always validate input parameters
- Return domain objects, not raw artifacts
- Include proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Use consistent response formats across endpoints
- Include pagination for list endpoints


## Development & Testing

### 15. Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for all async operations
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include user-friendly error messages for frontend

### 16. Debugging & Analytics
- If a new flow is constructed or modified, test by creating a node.js only testing script that executes transforms

## Data Validation

### 21. Input Validation
- Validate all input data at API boundaries
- Use TypeScript for compile-time type checking
- Include runtime validation for external data
- Test edge cases and error conditions
