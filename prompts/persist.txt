can we persist each run of ideation with sqlite? 
1. give each ideation run a UUID. 
2. for each idea (out of 5), store them separately in a table.
3. whenever an ideation is run, the frontend router url changes to a concreate url with ideation_id, such that if i refresh the page, the run still persist on page.

> Should visiting /ideation without an ID create a new ideation run?
yes. 
> Should there be a way to list/browse previous ideation runs?
sure
> When a new ideation is created, should it immediately redirect to the new URL?
ideation is created when "generate" button is clicked. 
6. same. let's persist an ideation run when something is generated by the llm.


ask any clarification questions before implementing.
